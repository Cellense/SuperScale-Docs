# Daily Activity (DAU)

Monitor daily active user patterns and engagement metrics to understand your app's day-to-day performance and user behavior trends.

## Overview

The Daily Activity dashboard provides comprehensive insights into your daily active users (DAU), helping you track engagement patterns, identify trends, and make data-driven decisions about user retention and product optimization.

## Key Metrics

### Primary KPIs
- **Average DAU** - The average number of daily active users over the selected period
- **Average Daily Time in Game** - How long users spend in your app per day on average
- **Average Daily Session Count** - The typical number of sessions users have per day

## Visualization Sections

### DAU by Platform
Track daily active users across different platforms (iOS, Android) over time. This visualization helps you:
- Compare platform performance
- Identify platform-specific trends
- Understand your user base distribution
- Monitor the impact of platform-specific updates or campaigns

### DAU by App Version
Analyze user adoption and retention across different app versions. This breakdown enables you to:
- Monitor version migration patterns
- Identify versions with higher or lower retention
- Understand the impact of updates on user engagement
- Plan deprecation strategies for older versions

### DAU Distribution
View the distribution of daily active users across:
- **Platform Distribution** - Split between iOS and Android users
- **Cohort Age Segments** - Users grouped by how long they've been active (new users, 1-30 days, 31-90 days, etc.)

This helps you understand:
- Platform balance in your user base
- User lifecycle patterns
- Retention across different user segments

### Monthly Activity Trends
Get a broader perspective with Monthly Active Users (MAU) by platform, showing:
- Long-term growth trends
- Seasonal patterns
- Platform-specific user base evolution

### Daily Sessions and Time in Game Analysis
Detailed breakdown of user engagement through:
- **Daily Time in Game** - Statistical analysis including quartiles and average time spent
- **Daily Session Count** - Number of sessions per day with statistical breakdowns
- **Cohort Age Segment Analysis** - How engagement varies by user maturity
