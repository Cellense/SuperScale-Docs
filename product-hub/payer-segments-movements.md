# Payer Segments - Movements

Analyze advanced payer segment transitions to understand how users move between different spending behaviors and optimize conversion and retention strategies.

## Overview

The Payer Segments Movements dashboard provides deep insights into how users transition between different payer segments over time. This analysis is crucial for understanding user lifecycle progression, identifying conversion opportunities, and optimizing strategies to move users toward higher-value segments.

## Key Metrics

### Primary KPIs
- **Whale Cutoff (month)** - Spending threshold for whale classification in current period
- **Whale Cutoff (trimester)** - Spending threshold for whale classification over trimester
- **Number of Payers** - Total active paying users
- **Number of Players** - Total active users
- **IAP Revenue** - Total in-app purchase revenue
- **ARPPU** - Average Revenue Per Paying User

## Segment Definitions

### Active Segments
- **Whale** - High-value users exceeding whale spending thresholds
- **Repeater** - Users making multiple purchases but below whale threshold
- **One-Shot** - Users making single purchases in the period
- **Non-Payer** - Active users who don't make purchases

### Inactive/New Segments
- **Inactive** - Previously active users who became dormant
- **Non-Existent** - New users who weren't present in previous period

## Visualization Sections

### MAU by Segment
Long-term segment evolution tracking:
- **Historical Trends** - Monthly active users across all segments over time
- **Segment Growth Patterns** - How each segment grows or shrinks over months
- **Lifecycle Understanding** - Long-term user behavior patterns

Key insights you can gather:
- Identify seasonal patterns in segment behavior
- Track the overall health of your payer ecosystem
- Monitor long-term trends in user value progression
- Understand the stability of different segments

### Movements between Segments
**Matrix Analysis (Selected Month vs. Previous Month/Trimester)**

This comprehensive matrix shows exactly how users moved between segments:

#### How to Read the Movement Matrix
- **Rows (Previous Period)** - Where users started
- **Columns (Selected Period)** - Where users ended up
- **Cell Values** - Number of users who made each transition

#### Example Interpretation
*"In the previous period, there were 41 whales - 13 became non-payers, 6 became one-shots, 9 became repeaters, and 13 remained whales. In the selected month, there are 45 whales (+4 increase) - 6 came from inactive, 18 from non-existent, 0 from non-payer, 5 from one-shot, 3 from repeater, and 13 remained whales."*

This reveals:
- **Retention Patterns** - How many users maintain their segment status
- **Conversion Success** - Movement from lower to higher value segments
- **Churn Risks** - Users moving to lower value or inactive segments
- **New User Integration** - How new users (non-existent) enter different segments

### Payer Segments Flow Visualization
**Sankey Diagram** showing visual flow between segments:
- **Flow Width** - Represents the volume of users moving between segments
- **Color Coding** - Different segments clearly identified
- **Direction Analysis** - Easy visualization of upgrade vs. downgrade patterns

Use this visualization to:
- Quickly identify major movement patterns
- Understand the overall flow direction (positive vs. negative)
- Spot unusual movement patterns that require investigation
- Communicate segment dynamics to stakeholders

### Segments by Distinct Product Set Purchased
**Detailed Product Analysis** showing:
- **Segment Transitions** - Current and previous segment for each user group
- **Product IDs** - Specific products purchased during transitions
- **Purchase Count** - Number of transactions
- **User Count** - How many users made each type of transition

This analysis helps you:
- Understand which products drive segment upgrades
- Identify products that appeal to users transitioning between segments
- Optimize product offerings for conversion strategies
- Plan targeted product recommendations for different transition scenarios

## Filtering Options

### Date Comparison
- **Month Selection** - Choose current month for analysis
- **Previous Period** - Compare against previous month or trimester
- **Comparison Type** - Switch between monthly and trimester analysis

### Geographic Filtering
- **Country Analysis** - Focus on specific geographic markets
- **Regional Patterns** - Understand cultural differences in segment movement

### Segment Focus
- **Selected Segment** - Filter movements for specific current segments
- **Previous Segment** - Focus on users coming from specific previous segments

### Product Analysis
- **Product ID** - Analyze movements related to specific products
- **Purchase Count** - Filter by transaction frequency

## Use Cases

### Conversion Optimization
- **Upgrade Pathways** - Identify successful paths from one-shot to repeater to whale
- **Product Strategy** - Understand which products drive segment upgrades
- **Timing Optimization** - Identify optimal timing for conversion campaigns

### Retention Strategy
- **Churn Prevention** - Identify users at risk of downgrading segments
- **Loyalty Programs** - Design programs to maintain high-value segment status
- **Re-engagement** - Target inactive users for re-activation campaigns

### Business Intelligence
- **Revenue Forecasting** - Predict revenue based on segment movement patterns
- **User Lifecycle Planning** - Understand natural progression patterns
- **Market Analysis** - Compare segment dynamics across different regions

### Product Development
- **Feature Impact** - Understand how new features affect segment transitions
- **Monetization Optimization** - Design products that encourage segment upgrades
- **User Experience** - Optimize experiences for different transition scenarios

## Understanding Movement Patterns

### Positive Movement Indicators
- **Upward Transitions** - Users moving from lower to higher value segments
- **New User Conversion** - Non-existent users entering paying segments
- **Retention Stability** - High percentage of users maintaining segment status
- **Re-activation Success** - Inactive users returning to active paying segments

### Warning Signals
- **Downward Trends** - High-value users moving to lower segments
- **Increased Churn** - Users moving from active to inactive status
- **Poor New User Integration** - Non-existent users not converting to payers
- **Segment Instability** - High volatility in segment transitions

## Strategic Applications

### Conversion Funnel Optimization
1. **Identify Bottlenecks** - Find where users get stuck in segment progression
2. **Optimize Touchpoints** - Improve experiences at critical transition moments
3. **Product Recommendations** - Suggest products that historically drive upgrades
4. **Timing Strategies** - Target users at optimal moments for conversion

### Retention and Loyalty
1. **Early Warning Systems** - Identify users at risk of segment downgrade
2. **Targeted Interventions** - Create specific programs for different movement patterns
3. **Loyalty Rewards** - Design rewards that encourage segment stability and growth
4. **Win-back Campaigns** - Re-engage users who've moved to lower segments

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Monitoring** - Track movement patterns monthly to identify trends
2. **Cohort Analysis** - Understand how different user cohorts move between segments
3. **Product Correlation** - Connect product purchases with segment transitions
4. **Geographic Insights** - Analyze movement patterns across different markets
5. **Predictive Modeling** - Use historical movement data to predict future transitions
6. **Intervention Planning** - Develop strategies for each type of segment movement
7. **Success Metrics** - Define KPIs for successful segment progression
