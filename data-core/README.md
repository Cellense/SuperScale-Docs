## Getting Started

1. Select your project from the portfolio
2. Navigate to Processing Core
3. Choose "Create Pipeline" to build your first automated workflow
4. Use the visual designer to configure actions, conditions, and flow control
5. Test your pipeline in a safe environment before production deployment
6. Monitor execution through the dashboard and optimize performance as needed

## Key Concepts

- **Pipeline**: A complete automated workflow with multiple connected steps
- **Actions**: Individual operations like SQL queries, scripts, or external API calls
- **Conditions**: Logic gates that control workflow branching and execution paths
- **Triggers**: Events or schedules that initiate pipeline execution
- **Nodes**: Visual components in the pipeline designer representing actions or conditions
