## Best Practices

### Query Development
- Write efficient, well-structured SQL queries with proper indexing strategies
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks
- Implement proper error handling and transaction management
- Test queries thoroughly in development environments before production deployment
- Document complex queries with comments explaining business logic

### Performance Optimization

- Use appropriate indexes and avoid unnecessary full table scans
- Implement data partitioning for large tables when appropriate
- Consider query caching for frequently executed operations
- Monitor query performance and set up alerts for slow-running queries

### Maintenance Strategy
- Regularly review and optimize frequently used queries
- Keep database statistics up to date for optimal query planning
- Implement automated backup and recovery procedures
- Monitor database performance and capacity planning
- Establish procedures for handling database schema changes
