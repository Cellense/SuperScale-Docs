# Tutorial

Analyze your onboarding tutorial performance to optimize user experience and improve tutorial completion rates across different segments.

## Overview

The Tutorial dashboard provides comprehensive insights into your app's onboarding funnel, helping you understand where users drop off during the tutorial process and how to optimize the initial user experience. This analysis is critical for improving first-time user engagement and setting users up for long-term success.

## Key Metrics

### Primary KPIs
- **Tutorial Start Users** - Number of users who begin the tutorial process
- **Tutorial Finish Users** - Number of users who complete the entire tutorial
- **Tutorial Conversion** - Percentage of users who complete the tutorial after starting
- **Average Time to Finish** - Average duration for users to complete the tutorial

## Visualization Sections

### Tutorial Funnel Overview
Comprehensive funnel analysis showing:
- **Step-by-Step Progression** - Visual representation of user flow through each tutorial step
- **Drop-off Analysis** - Identify exactly where users leave the tutorial
- **Completion Metrics** - Overall tutorial performance statistics

Key insights you can gather:
- Identify problematic tutorial steps with high drop-off rates
- Understand the overall tutorial completion efficiency
- Monitor tutorial performance trends over time
- Compare completion rates across different user segments

### Tutorial Steps and Time Analysis
Detailed breakdown of each tutorial step including:
- **User Volume per Step** - How many users reach each tutorial milestone
- **Average Time Since Last Step** - Time users spend on each tutorial step
- **Drop Rate Analysis** - Percentage of users who abandon at each step
- **Step-by-Step Performance** - Completion efficiency for individual tutorial components

This dual-chart analysis helps you:
- Identify steps that take too long and may frustrate users
- Find steps with unusually high drop-off rates
- Optimize tutorial pacing and content
- Balance educational value with user engagement

### Detailed Step Performance Table
Comprehensive step-by-step analysis featuring:
- **User Progression** - Exact user counts reaching each step
- **Drop from Previous Step** - Percentage and absolute drop-off between consecutive steps
- **Average Time Since Last Step** - Time investment required for each step
- **Drop/Time Ratio** - Efficiency metric showing drop rate relative to time investment

Use this detailed breakdown to:
- Pinpoint exact problematic steps in your tutorial
- Understand time investment vs. educational value trade-offs
- Identify steps that may be too complex or time-consuming
- Optimize step sequencing and content

### Tutorial Performance by App Version
Version-specific tutorial analysis showing:
- **Install App Version** - Which app version users started with
- **Tutorial Start vs. Finish Users** - Completion funnel by version
- **Conversion Rate by Version** - Tutorial completion percentage across different app versions
- **Average Time to Finish** - How tutorial completion time varies by version

This comparison enables you to:
- Assess the impact of tutorial changes across app updates
- Identify versions with particularly strong or weak tutorial performance
- Make data-driven decisions about tutorial improvements
- Track the effectiveness of onboarding optimizations over time

## Filtering Options

- Focus analysis on early vs. late tutorial stages

### Include Optional Steps
- Toggle analysis to include or exclude optional tutorial components
- Understand the impact of optional vs. required tutorial elements

## Use Cases

### Onboarding Optimization
- **Drop-off Point Identification** - Find where users abandon the tutorial most frequently
- **Step Timing Optimization** - Adjust tutorial pacing based on time-per-step analysis
- **Content Refinement** - Improve tutorial steps with high drop rates or excessive time requirements

### User Experience Enhancement
- **Friction Reduction** - Eliminate or simplify steps that cause significant user drop-off
- **Engagement Balance** - Optimize tutorial length to balance education with user patience
- **Platform Customization** - Tailor tutorial experience based on platform-specific performance

### Product Development
- **Feature Introduction Strategy** - Understand how well tutorials introduce core product features
- **Version Impact Assessment** - Measure how tutorial changes affect user onboarding success
- **A/B Testing Support** - Compare tutorial variants using completion and timing metrics

### Business Impact Analysis
- **Retention Correlation** - Connect tutorial completion with long-term user retention
- **Conversion Optimization** - Improve tutorial completion to drive better downstream metrics
- **User Segmentation** - Understand how different user types interact with the tutorial

## Understanding Tutorial Performance

### Healthy Tutorial Patterns
- **Gradual Drop-off** - Steady but manageable user decline through tutorial steps
- **Reasonable Step Times** - Balanced time investment that doesn't overwhelm users
- **High Overall Completion** - Strong conversion rate from start to finish
- **Consistent Cross-Platform Performance** - Similar effectiveness on iOS and Android

### Warning Signals
- **Steep Early Drop-offs** - Large user losses in first few tutorial steps
- **Extended Step Times** - Users spending excessive time on individual steps
- **Version Performance Decline** - Tutorial completion rates dropping with app updates
- **Platform Disparities** - Significant differences between iOS and Android completion rates

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Monitoring** - Review tutorial metrics weekly to catch issues early
2. **Step-by-Step Analysis** - Focus on individual step performance rather than just overall completion
3. **Time Investment Tracking** - Monitor how long users spend on each tutorial step
4. **Version Comparison** - Always compare tutorial performance across app versions
5. **Cross-Platform Optimization** - Ensure tutorial works effectively on both iOS and Android
6. **Optional vs. Required Balance** - Understand the impact of optional tutorial elements
7. **Iterative Improvement** - Use data to continuously refine and optimize the tutorial experience
8. **Correlation Analysis** - Connect tutorial completion with downstream user behavior and retention

This dashboard is essential for creating an effective onboarding experience that sets users up for long-term engagement and success with your product.
