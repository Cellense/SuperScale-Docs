# Cohort Activity (Retention)

Analyze user retention patterns and cohort performance to understand long-term user engagement and optimize your retention strategies.

## Overview

The Cohort Activity dashboard provides deep insights into user retention patterns by tracking how groups of users (cohorts) behave over time. This analysis is crucial for understanding product stickiness, identifying retention bottlenecks, and measuring the long-term value of user acquisition efforts.

## Key Metrics

### Primary KPIs
- **Installs** - Total number of app installations for the selected period
- **Retention D1** - Percentage of users who return on day 1 after install
- **Retention D7** - Percentage of users who return on day 7 after install
- **Retention D14** - Percentage of users who return on day 14 after install
- **Retention D30** - Percentage of users who return on day 30 after install
- **Retention D60** - Percentage of users who return on day 60 after install

## Visualization Sections

### Retention Analysis
Interactive cohort retention chart showing:
- **Platform Breakdown** - Compare retention rates between iOS and Android
- **Day-by-Day Retention** - Track how retention evolves from Day 1 through Day 365
- **Cohort Comparison** - Compare retention performance across different user cohorts

Key insights you can gather:
- Identify critical drop-off points in the user journey
- Compare platform-specific retention patterns
- Understand long-term user engagement trends
- Benchmark retention performance over time

### Installs by Platform
Monitor new user acquisition trends with:
- **Time Series Analysis** - Track install volumes over time by platform
- **Platform Distribution** - Understand the balance between iOS and Android installs
- **Trend Identification** - Spot seasonal patterns or campaign-driven spikes

This helps you:
- Understand acquisition velocity and patterns
- Correlate install volumes with retention performance
- Plan marketing budgets based on platform performance
- Identify optimal times for user acquisition campaigns

### Retention Dx Trendline
Advanced retention trend analysis showing:
- **Multi-Day Retention Trends** - Track D1, D3, D7, D14, D30, D60, D90, D180, and D365 retention over time
- **Performance Evolution** - See how retention rates change across different cohort start dates
- **Comparative Analysis** - Compare retention performance across multiple time horizons

Use this to:
- Identify improvements or deterioration in retention over time
- Understand the impact of product changes on long-term retention
- Set realistic retention benchmarks for different time periods
- Monitor the effectiveness of retention initiatives

### Retention Dx by App Version
Detailed retention analysis segmented by app version:
- **Version Performance Matrix** - Compare retention rates across different app versions and time periods
- **Cross-Version Analysis** - Understand how different updates impact user retention
- **Performance Benchmarking** - Identify which versions drive the best long-term engagement

This matrix helps you:
- Assess the impact of specific app updates on retention
- Identify problematic versions that hurt user engagement
- Make data-driven decisions about version deprecation
- Optimize future development priorities

## Filtering Options

### Date Range
- Select custom date ranges to analyze specific cohort periods
- Compare retention across different time windows

### Platform
- Filter by iOS, Android, or view combined data
- Understand platform-specific retention characteristics

### Geography
- Analyze retention patterns by country or region
- Identify geographic differences in user engagement

### Install App Version
- Focus on specific app versions for cohort analysis
- Compare retention across different product iterations

## Use Cases

### Product Development
- **Feature Impact Assessment** - Measure how new features affect long-term retention
- **Version Performance** - Identify which updates improve or hurt user stickiness
- **Roadmap Prioritization** - Focus development on features that drive retention

### User Acquisition Strategy
- **Channel Optimization** - Understand which acquisition sources bring users with better retention
- **Budget Allocation** - Invest more in channels that deliver high-retention users
- **Platform Strategy** - Optimize spend between iOS and Android based on retention quality

### Retention Optimization
- **Critical Point Identification** - Find where users typically drop off and focus intervention efforts
- **Benchmarking** - Set realistic retention targets based on historical performance
- **A/B Testing** - Measure the long-term impact of retention experiments

### Business Planning
- **LTV Estimation** - Use retention curves to estimate customer lifetime value
- **Growth Forecasting** - Predict future active user base based on retention patterns
- **Monetization Strategy** - Understand user engagement patterns to optimize monetization timing

## Understanding Retention Curves

### Healthy Retention Patterns
- **Strong D1 Retention** - Indicates good onboarding and initial user experience
- **Stable Long-term Retention** - Shows product-market fit and sustained value delivery
- **Platform Consistency** - Similar retention patterns across iOS and Android suggest universal appeal

### Warning Signals
- **Steep Early Drop-offs** - May indicate onboarding issues or poor initial user experience
- **Declining Long-term Retention** - Could suggest lack of content depth or engagement mechanics
- **Platform Disparities** - Large differences between iOS and Android may indicate platform-specific issues

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Monitoring** - Track retention trends weekly to identify changes early
2. **Cohort Comparison** - Always compare current cohorts to historical benchmarks
3. **Platform Analysis** - Investigate significant differences between iOS and Android retention
4. **Version Impact Assessment** - Monitor retention changes after major updates
5. **Segmentation Deep-dive** - Use additional filters to understand retention drivers
6. **Long-term Focus** - Don't just optimize for D1; consider D7, D30, and beyond
7. **Correlation Analysis** - Connect retention patterns with product changes, marketing campaigns, and external factors

This dashboard is essential for understanding the long-term health of your user base and making informed decisions about product development, user acquisition, and retention strategies.
