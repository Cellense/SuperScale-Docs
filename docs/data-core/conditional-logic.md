# Conditional Logic

Conditional Logic components enable sophisticated workflow branching and decision-making within your automated pipelines, allowing for dynamic execution paths based on runtime conditions.

## Condition Types

### Wait Until Conditions
- **Time-Based Waiting** - Pause execution until specific times or dates
- **Data Availability** - Wait for data to become available in tables or files
- **System Status** - Monitor external system readiness and availability
- **API Response** - Wait for specific responses from external services
- **File Existence** - Pause until required files are present and accessible

### Wait For Operations
- **Duration Delays** - Fixed time delays for system synchronization
- **Polling Intervals** - Regular checks for condition fulfillment
- **Timeout Controls** - Maximum wait times with fallback actions
- **Exponential Backoff** - Intelligent retry strategies for external dependencies
- **Business Hour Restrictions** - Limit execution to specific time windows

### Query-Based Conditions
- **Data Validation** - Check data quality, completeness, and integrity
- **Threshold Monitoring** - Trigger actions based on metric thresholds
- **Count Verification** - Validate expected record counts and data volumes
- **Value Comparisons** - Compare values against expected ranges or patterns
- **Complex Logic** - Multi-criteria evaluation with AND/OR operations

### Table Operations
- **Schema Validation** - Verify table structure and column existence
- **Data Type Checking** - Ensure data types match expected formats
- **Constraint Verification** - Check primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints
