# Pipeline Overview

The Pipeline Overview provides a centralized dashboard for managing all your automated workflows and processing pipelines.

## Features

### Pipeline Dashboard
- **Visual Pipeline Designer** - Interactive visual representation of pipeline workflow with connected nodes
- **Real-time Status Monitoring** - View the current status of all pipelines with live updates
- **Pipeline Runs Table** - Comprehensive table showing execution history, run types, and performance metrics
- **Manual Run Capability** - Execute pipelines manually with immediate feedback and monitoring
- **Search & Filtering** - Find specific pipelines by name, status, creator, or execution date

### Pipeline Management
- **Create New Pipelines** - Launch the visual pipeline designer to build custom workflows
- **Clone & Template** - Duplicate existing pipelines or use pre-built templates
- **Bulk Operations** - Manage multiple pipelines simultaneously
- **Version Control** - Track pipeline changes and revert to previous versions

### Status Types
- **Successful** - Pipeline completed without errors
- **Failed** - Pipeline encountered errors during execution
- **Running** - Pipeline is currently executing
- **Scheduled** - Pipeline is waiting for trigger conditions
- **Paused** - Pipeline execution has been manually halted

## Performance Metrics

### Execution Statistics
- **Total Duration** - Time taken for complete pipeline execution
- **Processing Volume** - Amount of data processed during execution
- **Success Rate** - Percentage of successful executions over time
- **Resource Usage** - CPU, memory, and storage consumption metrics

### Optimization Insights
- **Bottleneck Identification** - Pinpoint slow-performing pipeline components
- **Resource Recommendations** - Suggestions for improving efficiency
- **Cost Analysis** - Breakdown of execution costs and optimization opportunities

## Best Practices

### Pipeline Organization
- Use descriptive names that clearly indicate the pipeline's purpose
- Tag pipelines by project, department, or functional area
- Implement consistent naming conventions across your organization
- Document pipeline dependencies and relationships

### Monitoring Strategy
- Set up alerts for critical pipeline failures
- Monitor execution times to detect performance degradation
- Review error logs regularly to identify recurring issues
- Establish escalation procedures for mission-critical workflows
