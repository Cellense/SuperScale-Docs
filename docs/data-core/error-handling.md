# Error Handling

Error Handling provides robust mechanisms for managing failures, implementing recovery strategies, and maintaining workflow reliability across your automated pipeline operations.

## Error Detection & Classification

### Error Types

### Error Severity Levels
- **Critical** - Errors that halt pipeline execution and require immediate attention
