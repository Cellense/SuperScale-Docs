- Monitor integration performance and optimize bottlenecks
- Use batch processing for large data volumes when real-time isn't required
- Plan for peak usage periods and scale resources accordingly

### Security Guidelines
- Regularly rotate authentication credentials and access tokens
- Use least privilege principles for integration access permissions
- Monitor integration access patterns for unusual activity
- Implement proper data encryption for sensitive information
- Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments
