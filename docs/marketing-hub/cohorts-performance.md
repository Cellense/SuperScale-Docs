# Cohorts Performance

The Cohorts Performance report provides detailed analysis of user cohorts over time, allowing you to track how groups of users acquired on specific dates perform throughout their lifecycle.

## Overview

This report focuses on cohort analysis, which groups users by their acquisition date and tracks their performance metrics (ROAS, retention, conversion) over time. This is essential for understanding user value progression and identifying trends in user quality across different acquisition periods.

**Important Note**: "ROAS predictions are available from D4 of cohorts"

## How to Use This Report

### 1. Cohort Comparison Analysis
- Select multiple cohorts to compare performance
- Look for patterns in ROAS progression
- Identify high-performing acquisition periods

### 2. Performance Forecasting
- Use early day metrics (D0-D3) to predict long-term performance
- Compare current cohorts against historical benchmarks
- Adjust acquisition strategies based on cohort quality trends

### 3. Budget Optimization
- Identify time periods with highest-quality cohorts
- Allocate more budget to channels/campaigns producing better cohorts
- Reduce spend during periods with poor cohort performance

### 4. Quality Assessment
- Monitor day-over-day ROAS growth patterns
- Flag cohorts with unusual performance patterns
- Track conversion and retention improvements

## Key Insights to Look For

### Performance Patterns
- **Strong Start**: Cohorts with high D0-D1 ROAS often continue performing well
- **Growth Trajectories**: Steep early growth usually indicates quality users
- **Plateau Points**: When ROAS growth stabilizes varies by cohort quality

### Seasonality Effects
- **Day-of-Week Patterns**: Some days may consistently produce better cohorts
- **Campaign Timing**: Cohorts from different campaigns show varying patterns
- **Market Conditions**: External factors affecting cohort quality

### Predictive Indicators
- **Early Signals**: D1-D3 performance often predicts long-term outcomes
- **Conversion Timing**: When users start purchasing indicates engagement level
- **Retention Patterns**: Higher early retention correlates with better ROAS

## Advanced Analysis Tips

1. **Cross-Reference with UA Summary**: Compare cohort performance with overall UA metrics
2. **Geographic Analysis**: Break down cohorts by country for regional insights
3. **Channel Attribution**: Analyze which media sources produce the best cohorts
4. **Campaign Impact**: Correlate cohort performance with specific campaign changes
5. **Seasonal Trends**: Track cohort quality changes over different time periods

This cohort analysis enables precise understanding of user acquisition quality and helps optimize acquisition strategies based on actual user value progression over time.
