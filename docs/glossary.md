This glossary describes the main KPIs in the dashboard and their calculation approach.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

### Financial Metrics

**Spend** - User acquisition costs on paid campaigns

**NET Revenue** - Net USD revenue

**Return On Advertising Spend (ROAS)** = Revenue / Spend

**Estimated (Est.) Revenue** - Expected revenue based on the SuperScale prediction model

### User Acquisition Metrics

**Impressions** - Number of impressions from the ad channels

**Clicks** - Number of clicks on the paid ad

**Click-through Rate (CTR)** = Clicks / Impressions

**Cost Per Install (CPI)** = Spend / Installs

### User Metrics

**Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)** = Revenue / Users

## Day-based Metrics (Dx)

We refer to some metrics as **Dx** (or day) metrics. Day is defined as the number of days since the attribution date.

- **D0 revenue** - Revenue generated during the attribution date
- **D3 revenue** - Cumulative revenue for days 0, 1, 2 and 3
- **D13** - First two weeks (days 0-13)

For example, D7 revenue would be the cumulative revenue from the attribution date through day 7.
