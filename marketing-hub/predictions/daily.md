# Daily Predictions

The Daily Predictions module provides granular, day-level forecasting for cohort performance, enabling precise understanding of how specific daily cohorts will perform over time. This detailed prediction framework supports tactical decision-making, daily optimization, and short-term performance planning.

## Overview

Daily Cohort Estimated Performance focuses on predicting the performance trajectory of individual daily cohorts across key metrics including ROAS, LTV, and revenue. The predictions include confidence intervals and provide both calendar date and cohort day perspectives to enable comprehensive analysis of daily acquisition performance.
